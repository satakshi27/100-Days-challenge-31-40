Q31: Write a program to take a number as input and print its equivalent binary representation.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, binary = 0, base = 1, rem;          

    printf("Enter a number: ");             
    scanf("%d", &n);                           

    int temp = n;                              

    
    while (n > 0) {
        rem = n % 2;                            
        binary = binary + rem * base;           
        n = n / 2;                             
        base = base * 10;                       
    }

    printf("Binary = %d", binary);              

    return 0;                                    
}
